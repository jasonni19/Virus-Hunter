# Virus-Hunter
"Virus Hunter" was inspired by the need for an engaging and educational game that delves into the microscopic world of germs. By focusing on two distinct types of pathogens—Influenza and Ebola—the game aims to not only entertain but also inform players about these viruses and how the body's immune system combats them.


# What It Does
In "Virus Hunter," players take control of a white blood cell, navigating through the body to hunt down and eliminate germs. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and obstacles, all while learning important medical insights about the different behaviors and effects of Influenza and Ebola.

# How We Built It
The game was built using Python's Pygame library for the mechanics and gameplay. The graphical elements of the game were generated using generative AI drawings, creating a visually engaging and dynamic environment within the body. _ italics Game Control: Arrow Keys for movement, SPACE for shooting italics _

# Challenges We Ran Into
During development, we encountered challenges in balancing the gameplay to ensure it was both fun and educational. Integrating accurate medical information while keeping the game mechanics entertaining was a delicate balance. Additionally, optimizing the game's performance and ensuring smooth gameplay on various platforms posed technical hurdles.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We're proud to have created an immersive game that seamlessly blends entertainment with education. "Virus Hunter" provides players with a unique opportunity to learn about Influenza and Ebola, their effects on the body, and how the immune system responds to these threats—all in a captivating gaming experience.

# What We Learned
Through the development of "Virus Hunter," we gained a deeper understanding of game design principles, medical research, and the importance of conveying complex information in a user-friendly manner. We also honed our skills in Pygame usage, Object Orientated Programing, and leveraging AI-generated graphics for game development.

# What's Next for Virus Hunter
In the future, we plan to expand "Virus Hunter" with additional levels, each focusing on different types of pathogens. This will allow players to further explore the world of microbiology while encountering new challenges and learning experiences. Additionally, we aim to incorporate multiplayer features, enabling collaborative gameplay where players can work together to defeat outbreaks and save the body from infection.
